QuickList: Fast, easy task management
QuickList is a light Android application that eases daily task management with efficient performance. It supports the features of offline storage, dynamic user interface and modern design principles which ensure that, within the task management process, both simplicity and performance are maintained.

**Features**
Creating, editing, and deleting tasks can be achieved speedily.
Offline Support: All operations are stored locally using SQLite, so they can be used even without connectivity.
Dynamic UI with fluid scrolling and efficient view of tasks even when the list is large with RecyclerView.
Modest Design: Material Design and clean interface design for distraction-free presentation are followed in building.
Gesture Support: A touch-to-delete gesture to delete a task.
Lightweight and efficient. Optimized to provide seamless support on most Android devices.

**Technology Stack**
Front-end:
Java : Core application logic and structure.
RecyclerView: For rendering dynamic lists faster.
Backend:
SQLite Database: local storage supporting CRUD operations on tasks.
Development Tools
Android Studio : assists in writing, running and testing.
Material Design: a fresh and intuitive user interface.

**How It Works**
